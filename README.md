# Portfolio

This is the code for my online portfolio hosted at [https://drewcook.dev](https://drewcook.dev).

It is built in the Nuxt.js framework and written in Vue. I incoporated the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) component library for a more Material Design based theme.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

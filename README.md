# Portfolio

This is the code for my online portfolio hosted at [https://drewcook.dev](https://drewcook.dev).

### Tech Stack

- It is built in the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) framework and written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

- I incorporated the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) component library for a Material Design-based theme.

- I also made use of [Vue transitions](https://v1.vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html) in combination with [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) for a more interesting user experience.

- It contains [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) linting packages.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
